# A Blog Web-App Using MERN Stack
A simple blog web-app made with MERN Stack. User authentication will be added in a separate project.

## Why?
Major aim behind building this web app was to make a platform where you can add, edit and delete blogs without having the need to sign in. 
You can go to www.domain.com/addkarpost to add a new post, or /editkarpost/:id to edit one and /deletekarpost/:id to delete one. Obviously, keep these links or whatever you 
end up naming them a secret.

Moreoever, the this has CKEditor so you can an easily format text and add images in your blog.

## Bugs?
Yeah so, if you add a larger image on your blog content then basically everything explodes. 
I'll fix the CSS soon and also make some changes to the mobile-version of this website.

##Future Updates?
Like I said before, a seperate version continuing this project will be out soon that will contain user authentication and a bunch of other features like
claps (yeah, stealing it from medium) and maybe a few more. I haven't thought about it much yet.
